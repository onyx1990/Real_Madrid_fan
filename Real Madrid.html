     <p style="font-size: 20px;margin-top:20px;">Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for "royal" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 83,186-capacity Santiago Bernabéu in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting entities, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The official Madrid anthem is the "Hala Madrid y nada más", written by RedOne and Manuel Jabois.[6] The club is one of the most widely supported in the world, and is the most followed football club on social media according to the CIES Football Observatory as of 2023[7][8] and was estimated to be worth $5.1 billion in 2022, making it the world's most valuable football club.[9] In 2023, it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €713.8 million.</p>

             <p>Real Madrid news source: Pacheco, the former goalkeeper of the Real Madrid academy, who now plays for Espanyol, talked about his time in Real Madrid.

            He said: "I thank Casillas, Diego Lopez and Keylor Navas. There are people whom I admire and who behaved with professionalism. They helped me a lot to prepare for the road ahead. I am very grateful to Ancelotti. I thank him and the former goalkeeping coach of the team, William Vaki, who I hope his soul rests in peace. They were very important in my development and made me grow. I was able to play a Copa Era game in the senior team. When you look back, you will be thankful for such things. "</p>

            <p>Real Madrid news reference: Luka Modric, Toni Kroos and Lucas Vazquez, along with two loan players (Khoslo and Kepa), are six players in the Real Madrid squad who have contracts until the end of the season and the club must decide on them. As for Khoslo, his chances of staying seem high, while Lunin's brilliance has made Kepa's future uncertain.

            Modric, Kroos and Nacho were in a similar situation last season when they extended their contracts. The club tries to make decisions about players over 30 years old carefully and without haste and renew their contracts year after year.</p>
